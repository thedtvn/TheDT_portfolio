## What is Fantasy Bot?

Just a discord bot that i in 3 year that it make just for fun and to learn how to code a big project like that i add microservice to it like music api and songbird (like lavalink but in rust for save memory) node modun that run as microservice and can scale Horizontal and Vertical.

## Technology
- Python
  - Discord.py
  - Redis
  - Aiohttp ( API )
- Rust
- Java (Old Music API)
- Astro ( Frontend )
- Docker

## Lesson Learned
- Do not use redis as main database it will grow over time and become big and biger also you will need to code a proxy for it if want to save complexity structure.
- Java is using to many memory compare with rust and python.
- Always separate Dev and Production so it will be easier to test and manage and no downtime if code is broken.
