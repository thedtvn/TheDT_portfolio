## Why MB Bank?

I'm working on a payment system that need to access MB Bank bank to check transaction. But we i don't have 
corporate tax code to register MB Bank bisiness account to get access.

## What is mbbank-lib?

We designed a python library to access MB Bank API with python and get data from MB Bank. this library 
can be used in any python project. for example, we can use it in our payment system.
